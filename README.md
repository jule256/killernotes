# Killernotes

### @todo:

  - form evaluation
  - CSS Layouting
  - Importance: Stars/Flashes instead of select-dropdown
  - default values for due-create and due-time in create form
  - maybe fallback on Cookie if Storage is not supported on browser?
  - reset create form after kn:created
  - sort view: use handlebars correctly
  - style picker
  - JSDoc comments for "every" function
  - get variable-names straight: formElement/s vs. formOptions/s
  - find a better solution for the Date zero-padding problem
  - add (un)necessary files to .gitignore
  - implement "complete task" functionality
  - implement "completed" filter
  - don't allow edit-mode if another note is already in edit mode
  - maybe make preRender() and postRender() private, since they should not be called from outside
  - standardize event naming (maybe 'kn:`<type`>:`<action`>')
  - add JSCS and JSHint configuration
  - disable sorting during edit mode
  - Exception Handling
  - save data on server (wird gefordert)
  - templates should only be compiled once

### @ideas
  - Additional features
    - 
    - 
  - store/precompile handlebar templates
