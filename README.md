# Killernotes

### @todo:

  - form evaluation
  - CSS Layouting
  - Importance: Stars/Flashes instead of select-dropdown
  - default values for due-create and due-time in create form
  - maybe fallback on Cookie if Storage is not supported on browser?
  - reset create form after kn:created
  - sort view: use handlebars correctly
  - edit a note
  - style picker
  - JSDoc comments for "every" function
  - get variable-names straight: formElement/s vs. formOptions/s
  - find a better solution for the Date zero-padding problem
  - investigate bug with due-date "31.12.2014 23:44" -> display in view is wrong
